                                <p>Text mining & analytics is one of the fastest-growing applied streams in the analytics industry. In real business scenarios, the text data, in majority of the cases is unstructured, not cleansed, and not treated. Hence, the unstructured text data is not in a shape to use for any kind of insight generation, business analytics application, or leverage for decision support (predictive or prescriptive). It is of utmost importance to prepare the data prior to any kind of text analytics.

                                <p>Text classification and clustering form an integral part of analysing text data. In most business scenarios, it is important to analyse the text as a whole and as part of certain subgroups, which might not be apparent from simple frequency analysis. This is where clustering becomes necessary. Text Clustering helps one identify the underlying themes in text data, while also suggesting the number of themes that might be present in the data</p>
